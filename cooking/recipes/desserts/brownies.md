- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup chocolate chips (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
2. Melt butter and mix with sugar in a large bowl.
3. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla.
4. Sift together cocoa, flour, salt, and baking powder.
5. Fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined.
6. Fold in chocolate chips if using.
7. Pour batter into prepared pan and spread evenly.
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.

- For cake-like brownies, bake an extra 5 minutes
- Store in airtight container for up to 5 days
- Great with vanilla ice cream!
