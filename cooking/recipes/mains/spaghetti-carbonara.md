## Ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated
- 50g Parmesan cheese, grated
- Black pepper, freshly ground
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook spaghetti according to package directions.
2. While pasta cooks, fry pancetta in a large pan until crispy.
3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Pecorino, Parmesan, and lots of black pepper.
4. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta.
5. Remove pan from heat, add hot pasta to pancetta.
6. Quickly stir in egg mixture, adding pasta water to create a creamy sauce.
7. Serve immediately with extra cheese and pepper.

## Notes

- The key is to work quickly so eggs don't scramble
- Use freshly grated cheese for best results
- Traditional recipe uses guanciale, but pancetta or bacon work too
- Never add cream - it's not authentic!
