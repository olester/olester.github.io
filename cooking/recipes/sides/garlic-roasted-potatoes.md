- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Parmesan cheese (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. In a large bowl, toss potatoes with olive oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper.
3. Spread potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet, cut side down.
4. Roast for 35-40 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.
5. Remove from oven and toss with fresh parsley.
6. Optionally sprinkle with Parmesan cheese while still hot.
