## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup melted butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2. In another bowl, whisk buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla.
3. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir until just combined (lumps are okay).
4. Let batter rest for 5 minutes.
5. Heat a griddle or pan over medium heat and lightly grease.
6. Pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake.
7. Cook until bubbles form on surface, then flip.
8. Cook until golden brown on both sides.

## Notes

- Don't overmix the batter - lumps are fine and make fluffier pancakes
- If you don't have buttermilk, add 2 tbsp lemon juice to regular milk
- Serve with maple syrup, fresh berries, or whipped cream
